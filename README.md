# Wallpaper Reader
My first attempt at building a program to identify wallpaper files used in Windows 10
## Background
I know there are hundreds of examples of this one the web, but so far I am not finding any simple, clean-cut versions.
I've decided to experiment with the many found to try and build a simple, easy app to identify the wallpaper files assigned to each monitor on a desktop. This is more for "self-development" than anything else.
## My Background
I've been playing in programming for more than 20 years now, but have only just recently decided to get back in to it, hence this and hopefully future projects.
I have previously programmed in several different languages but now have decided to focus on more "recent" languages such as Python and GoLang, to go alongside my scripting and other specialties.
## Help and anything else
I am happy for anyone to offer suggestions on this and other projects as I create them, as that is the whole point of going public (or so I believe). So everyone can improve and share.
